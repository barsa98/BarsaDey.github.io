<h1>Understanding how life becomes diverse</h1>

<p>
I am drawn to the question of how life becomes diverse.
Across landscapes, histories, and minds,
I look for the quiet forces that shape who we are
evolution, memory, environment, and time.
</p>

</p>  
I have long been fascinated by the way conditions shape existence—
how cells adapt,
how brains change,
how cultures form,
and how traditions endure.

This curiosity led me toward biology, cognition, and computational research,
where I study patterns hidden within images and data
to better understand disease, variation, and adaptation.

Yet the same questions continue beyond the laboratory.
In unfamiliar streets, shared meals, forgotten histories, and local rituals,
I see evolution expressed in human language
not only in genes, but in ways of living.

For me, science and lived experience are not separate inquiries.
They are reflections of the same unfolding story.
</p>

<p>
My work in biological data and medical imaging is one path into this question.
My journeys through places, food, and living traditions are another.
Together, they form a single pursuit:
<strong>to understand how complexity becomes meaning.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p class="soft">
My academic work explores life through data-driven biological understanding, including:

Medical imaging and radiogenomics

Machine learning approaches to biological complexity

Cognition, neurological change, and disease

Evolutionary perspectives on diversity and adaptation

Beneath these themes lies a single question that continues to guide me:

How do complex systems—biological or cultural—become so richly diverse?
</p>

<p>
Through images, data, and computation, I try to listen to the subtle
patterns through which biology speaks.
</p>

<h2>Journeys & Fragments</h2>
<p>
Learning, to me, is also movement.

I travel to listen—
to landscapes shaped by climate,
to foods shaped by survival,
to traditions shaped by centuries of memory,
to worldviews shaped by different beginnings.

Photography and writing allow me to hold these moments gently—
not as destinations reached,
but as questions still unfolding.

Each journey reminds me that diversity is not accidental.
It is time made visible.
</p>

<p>
I continue to search for connections
between biology and belief,
between cognition and culture,
between evolution and identity.

Through research and exploration,
I hope to keep learning
how life becomes
so endlessly, quietly beautiful in its diversity.
