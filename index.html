<h1>Understanding how life becomes diverse</h1>

<p>
I am drawn to the quiet forces that shape existence—evolution, memory,
environment, and time.
</p>

<p>
My work in biological data and medical imaging is one path into this question.
My journeys through places, food, and living traditions are another.
Together, they form a single pursuit:
<strong>to understand how complexity becomes meaning.</strong>

<p>
Through images, data, and computation, I try to listen to the subtle
patterns through which biology speaks.

<h2>Journeys & Fragments</h2>
<p>
I travel to listen—to landscapes shaped by climate, foods shaped by
survival, and traditions shaped by centuries of memory.
</p>

<p>
Photography and writing allow me to hold these moments gently,
as questions rather than conclusions.
